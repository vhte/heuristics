heuristics
==========

One of my MS works. This is about applying metaheuristics in unrelated parallel machine scheduling problem.
I'll use two of them. Probably GRASP+ISL and another which I've not decided yet.

I'm going to use "L. Fanjul, and R. Ruiz, (2010). Iterated greedy local search methods for unrelated parallel machine scheduling. *European Journal of Operational Research, 207*(1), 55-69." instances with my algorithms and try to get better results than IG. Still in research
